* Introduction

This repository contains the DAS4-dissemination emulation.  It is
intended to run multiple peers simultaneously while disseminating
messages in various scenarios.

Each scenario uses its own configuration file and is described below.
Running a scenario should be as simple as calling =./run.sh CONFIG=
from your DAS4 account.  Results are stored in
=/var/scratch/$USER/resultdir-dissemination=.  Run
=~/das4-dissemination/evaluation/99-all.sh= from this directory to
evaluate the results.

There is a Jenkins job running these emulations periodically, see
http://jenkins.tribler.org/job/Experiment_Dissemination_Boudewijn/.

* one_to_all_largest_3000.config

With the one_to_all_largest_3000 emulation a single peer (peer#0)
starts by generating 3000 messages.  The emulation is considered
successful when after 15 minutes all peers have obtained all 3000
messages.

* one_to_all_modulo_3000.config

Similar to the one_to_all_largest_3000 emulation, except that the
modulo synchronisation strategy is used.
